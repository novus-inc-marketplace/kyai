You are a full-stack UI/UX + frontend engineer. I just deployed the Barakah Roots site (React + Tailwind CSS + Node) and the production page is rendering with default browser styles (unstyled, serif fonts, no Tailwind layout or color — see attached screenshot). Use the instructions and design requirements in prompt.txt (cream + light green theme, Tailwind setup, Framer Motion, accessibility targets). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Task: Fully diagnose why Tailwind styling is not applying and fix the build/deploy pipeline so the live site matches the Tailwind-based design in prompt.txt. Provide a clear root-cause, exact code patch (diff/PR) or commands to fix, and a verification checklist.

Start by performing these checks (in this exact order) and report findings:

1) Static/CSS delivery check (quick network check)
- Open the deployed site and inspect the Network tab in devtools.
  - Is the main CSS file requested? (e.g. `/styles.css`, `/index.css`, `/_next/static/css/...`, or `main.<hash>.css`)
  - What is the HTTP status? (200, 404, 500)
  - What is the Content-Type header? (should be text/css)
- If no CSS file is requested: note that CSS is not bundled/linked. If requested but 404: the build did not output the CSS to the deployed assets.

2) Verify compiled CSS contents
- Download the served CSS file (or the built CSS in your build output).
- Confirm it contains Tailwind output:
  - Look for Tailwind preflight rules: `/*! tailwindcss v... */` or class selectors like `.bg-light-green`, `.text-barakah-text`, or utility rules like `.p-4`, `.flex`.
- If the file contains very little CSS (or only a few rules), Tailwind might have been purged incorrectly or not built.

3) Verify project config files (paths & contents to inspect)
Open and copy relevant content of these files:
- `tailwind.config.js`
  - Confirm `content` (or `purge`) includes the correct globs: `./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html}` (for CRA/React) or `./pages/**/*` (for Next) depending on framework.
- `postcss.config.js`
  - Confirm it includes `require('tailwindcss')` and `require('autoprefixer')`.
- `package.json` scripts
  - `build`, `start`, `postinstall`, `dev` — show these scripts.
- Global CSS import
  - For CRA: check `src/index.js` or `src/index.jsx` has `import './index.css'` (or the path used). For Next: check `pages/_app.js` imports the global CSS.
- The global CSS file (e.g. `src/index.css` or `styles/globals.css`)
  - Confirm it contains `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` and not only custom rules.

4) Common misconfigurations to check (explicitly)
- Tailwind `content` globs too narrow so all classes were purged during production build (very common). Example bad: `content: ['./public/index.html']` only.
- Using classnames built dynamically (string concatenation or templates) that Purge can't see — recommend using `classnames` or safelist.
- Missing import of compiled CSS in server-rendered HTML or incorrect path in `<link>` tag.
- PostCSS/Tailwind not run during build (e.g., CI omitted `NODE_ENV=production npm run build`, or missing PostCSS plugin in pipeline).
- Using CDN or remote CSS but forgetting to generate the Tailwind CSS before deployment.
- If using Next.js/SSR: Ensure `next.config.js` not misconfigured to strip css or static export without copying CSS.

5) Reproduce locally: exact commands to run (agent should run these and paste outputs)
- `git status --porcelain` and `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` (branch info)
- `npm ci` or `npm install`
- `npm run build` (capture stdout & stderr)
- Inspect `build/` or `.next/static/css/` output. Show `ls -la` of the build output directory and `du -h` of CSS files.
- `node server.js` or `serve -s build` to run a local production preview — open http://localhost:5000 and confirm styling.

6) Rapid tests to identify cause (agent should run, copy + paste outputs)
- Search for `@tailwind` directives: `rg "@tailwind" -n --hidden`
- Check tailwind config content globs: print `tailwind.config.js`
- Print first 200 lines of built CSS: `head -n 200 build/static/css/*.css` (or relevant path)

Deliverables I expect from you:
A) **Diagnosis report** (concise)
- Root cause(s) (one-liner), e.g.:
  - "Tailwind CSS not generated because `postcss.config.js` missing tailwind plugin" OR
  - "Tailwind built but Purge/Content globs were incorrect so all utilities removed in production" OR
  - "Compiled CSS built but not linked in server HTML (wrong path)."
- Evidence (screenshots, log excerpts, filenames + snippets showing the problem).

B) **Fix / patch** (applyable)
- Provide a git diff / patch or exact file replacements for every changed file.
- If config changes: show the before and after `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
- If import changes: show the change to `src/index.js` or `pages/_app.js`.
- If build script changes: show `package.json` scripts edits.
- If CI/deploy changes: give exact changes to the deploy config (Vercel build commands, Netlify publish directory, or Dockerfile).

C) **Exact commands to run** (for me or CI)
- e.g.:
  - `npm ci && npm run build`
  - `NODE_ENV=production npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./build/assets/tailwind.css --minify` (if needed)
- If temporary hotfix: add inline minimal CSS snippet to make the site readable while fixing pipeline.

D) **Verification checklist** (what I will check after deploy)
- Visit live site and confirm:
  - CSS link loads 200 and contains Tailwind utilities.
  - Hero uses `Inter`/`Merriweather` fonts (fonts loaded).
  - Primary button uses `bg-light-green` color `#9FD6A5`.
  - Impact counters styled and centered; `h1` shows desired font-size and weight.
- Provide `curl -I https://<live-url>/path/to/css` and `curl https://<live-url>/path/to/css | head -n 20` outputs as verification.

E) **Optional improvements** (if quick)
- If cause is Purge stripping classes, add a Tailwind safelist for classes that are generated dynamically (show exact safelist).
- Provide a small `postinstall` script that ensures the compiled CSS is generated before deployment if the host doesn't run build hooks.

Priority fixes (if you must choose 1-2 urgent changes to deploy immediately):
1. Ensure `index.css` contains `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` and that it is imported in the app’s root (`src/index.js` or `pages/_app.js`).
2. Ensure `postcss.config.js` includes Tailwind plugin and `npm run build` runs PostCSS step.
3. Fix `tailwind.config.js` content globs to include all source files: `content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html}', './pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}']`.

Notes and context:
- The design & palette are in `prompt.txt` (cream #FFF7EC, light-green #9FD6A5, deep-olive #3F7D4A, etc.) — styling must follow those tokens. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- The screenshot indicates default serif fonts and no Tailwind utilities — this almost always means the compiled Tailwind CSS is not being loaded or it was purged during the build.

Final requirement for your response:
1. First, run the checks and paste the **evidence** (network log snippet, `ls` of build folder, head of CSS file, `tailwind.config.js` content).
2. Then, propose the **exact** code patch (git diff) and the commands I should run to rebuild + redeploy.
3. After applying the patch, run the verification steps and paste the `curl` outputs that show the correct CSS is now served.

Do not assume anything — show the concrete files/lines that prove the cause and attach the minimal patch to fix it. Follow the color/font/sizing rules in prompt.txt when verifying the result. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
