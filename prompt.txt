You are a full-stack UI/UX + frontend engineer assistant. Build a modern, fast, accessible website for "Barakah Roots — Kenya Youth Agricultural Initiative" (based on the attached Manifesto and Constitution). Use React for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion for animations, and Node.js for a simple backend/API. Produce design, component code structure, Tailwind theme extension, content/data schema, sample content, accessibility and SEO guidance, and deployment instructions. Focus on a clean cream + light-green theme, smooth transitions, micro-interactions, and modern UX patterns.

HIGH-LEVEL BRAND & VOICE
- Brand name: Barakah Roots — Kenya Youth Agricultural Initiative.
- Tone: hopeful, youth-empowering, action-oriented, conversational but professional.
- Use copy inspired by the organization's manifesto and constitution (focus on youth leadership, tree planting, climate impact, income generation). (Referenced docs: Manifesto & Constitution.)

DESIGN & PALETTE
- Main theme: Cream + Light Green.
- Provide 5 primary hex colors (primary, accent, neutral, text, subtle background):
  - Cream (main background): #FFF7EC
  - Light Green (primary buttons / accents): #9FD6A5
  - Deep Olive (primary dark / CTAs hover): #3F7D4A
  - Warm Sand (muted surfaces / cards): #F2E6D6
  - Text (dark): #203122
- Suggest 2 heading fonts (Google Fonts) and 1 UI font:
  - Headings: "Inter" (or "Poppins" — choose one)
  - Accent / Display: "Merriweather" for hero headings (optional)
  - Body/UI: "Inter"
- Provide Tailwind theme extension snippet for colors and fonts.

LAYOUT & PAGES (priority order)
1. Home / Hero
   - Full-bleed hero with large headline, short mission sentence, CTA buttons: "Adopt a Seedling" and "Join a Planting Drive".
   - Animated hero background: subtle parallax of tree silhouettes and floating leaves (Framer Motion).
   - Section: Impact counters (trees planted, youth trained, CO₂ sequestered) with count-up animations.
   - Quick links to "Adopt", "Volunteer", "Workshops", "Projects".

2. About (Mission & Vision)
   - Pull short mission text from manifesto + link to full Constitution/Manifesto downloads.
   - Timeline / Milestones component.

3. Projects / Planting Drives
   - Map or grid listing current projects, each card shows location, tree type, status, way to sponsor.
   - Filters: region, tree type, status.

4. Adopt a Seedling (E-commerce-ish)
   - Product list of seedlings (Avocado, Mango, Macadamia).
   - Simple checkout flow: sponsor, provide contact, select planting location (or remote donation).
   - Payment placeholder endpoints (Node backend stub—Stripe-ready notes).

5. Volunteer & Events
   - Calendar or upcoming drives with RSVP.

6. Training & Workshops
   - Course list, sign-up forms, downloadable materials, video embeds.

7. Stories / Impact (Blog)
   - Posts, testimonials, photo gallery with lightbox and lazy loading.

8. Members / Sponsors
   - Honor roll, sponsorship tiers, lifetime members.

9. Contact / Donate / Legal
   - Contact form, donation button, links to constitution & manifesto PDFs for transparency.

COMPONENTS & INTERACTIONS
- Global header: logo left, nav center/right, sticky with subtle backdrop blur after scroll; mobile hamburger transforms to sheet.
- Footer: quick links, social, newsletter signup.
- Hero: animated headline entrance (stagger, scale from 0.96 → 1), subtext fade-in, CTAs with micro hover scale & shadow.
- Card component: subtle lift on hover (translateY -6px, shadow), image top, content, tags.
- Modal / Lightbox: accessible, trap focus, ESC to close.
- CountUp component: animate numbers from 0 to target with easing.
- Map component: interactive markers with micro-interactions; fallback to list for low bandwidth.
- Image gallery: progressive loading + blurred placeholder.
- Forms: inline validation, success toasts, accessible labels, keyboard-first.

ANIMATIONS & MOTION GUIDELINES
- Use Framer Motion for layout / presence / list animations.
- Keep motion subtle and purposeful:
  - Durations: 300–500ms for entry/exit, 180–250ms for hovers.
  - Easing: cubic-bezier(.22,.9,.33,1) or use "easeOut".
- Use reduced-motion preference: respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Micro-interactions: button hover scale 1.03, focus ring with green 2px outline, link underline slide.

ACCESSIBILITY & PERFORMANCE
- All images: `alt` text, descriptive captions where relevant.
- Contrast: ensure text on cream backgrounds meets AA (dark text #203122).
- Keyboard navigation testable on all interactive components.
- Lighthouse target: >90 performance, >90 accessibility.
- Lazy load offscreen images, compress images, use modern formats (AVIF/WebP).
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA roles only where necessary.

SEO & METADATA
- Per-page meta: title, description, OG tags, Twitter cards.
- Structured data: JSON-LD for Organization, Event, and BlogPosting.
- Sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation in Node backend script.
- Canonical URLs and accessible breadcrumbs.

BACKEND (Node.js) SUGGESTIONS
- Simple Express/Koa API with routes:
- `GET /api/projects`
- `GET /api/projects/:id`
- `POST /api/adoptions` (create sponsorship)
- `POST /api/volunteer`
- `POST /api/contact`
- Stripe integration notes: create server endpoint to create PaymentIntent; return client secret to frontend.
- Admin panel: simple authenticated pages to add projects, update counts, upload photos (can be a basic React admin behind password + JWT).

TAILWIND THEME SNIPPET (example)
```js
// tailwind.config.js (extract)

  }
}
}

CODE STRUCTURE (suggested)

    /src

        /components (Header, Footer, Hero, Card, Modal, Form, Map, Gallery)

        /layouts (MainLayout, AdminLayout)

        /pages (Home, About, Projects, Adopt, Volunteer, Workshops, Stories, Contact)

        /lib (api client, utils, hooks)

SAMPLE HERO COPY

    Headline: "Plant a Tree. Grow a Future."

    Subtext: "Barakah Roots empowers Kenyan youth to plant income-generating fruit trees — building jobs, cooling cities and feeding families."

    Primary CTA: "Adopt a Seedling"

    Secondary CTA: "Join a Planting Drive"

CONTENT SOURCING & CMS

    Recommend a lightweight CMS: Netlify CMS, Strapi, or markdown + Git for content. Provide a content schema for projects, blog posts, and events.

    Store uploaded images in S3 or a CDN.

TESTING, LINTING & CI

    Frontend: React Testing Library + Jest for unit tests.

    E2E: Playwright for flows (Adopt checkout, volunteer sign-up).

    Lint: ESLint + Prettier; Tailwind CSS linting; Husky pre-commit hooks.

    CI: GitHub Actions to run tests and deploy to Vercel/Netlify.

DEPLOYMENT

    Frontend: Vercel (optimal for React/Next if chosen) or Netlify.

    Backend: Vercel Serverless Functions or a small Heroku/Render instance.

    Environment variables: STRIPE_KEY, CMS creds, DATABASE_URL.

    Use Cloudflare or Vercel CDN and enable caching headers.

DELIVERABLES (ask agent to produce these files)

    React component scaffolding for all pages and core components (with sample JSX + Tailwind classes + Framer Motion usage).

    tailwind.config.js extension and global CSS setup.

    Node.js Express server with example endpoints and Stripe stub.

    Sample seed JSON for projects, seedlings, and posts (10 sample records).

    SEO snippets: example meta tags, JSON-LD for Organization.

    Deployment guide (Vercel) and README.

    Accessibility checklist and Lighthouse baseline report script.

PRIORITY UX / SMALL DETAILS

    Respect reduced motion.

    Provide offline fallback for content that can be static (SWR or React Query caching).

    Make donation/adoption flow 2 steps max.

    Provide a small "impact dashboard" for admins to update counts quickly.

    Add shareable certificates (PDF generation endpoint) for sponsors with GPS coordinates when available.

EXTRA: SMALL UI KIT (button, input, card examples)

    Provide exact Tailwind classes for primary button:
    class="inline-flex items-center px-5 py-3 rounded-2xl bg-light-green text-white font-semibold shadow-md transform transition-transform hover:-translate-y-0.5 active:scale-95 focus:outline-none focus:ring-4 focus:ring-light-green/40"

    Provide card example:
    class="bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-xl p-4 shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow transform hover:-translate-y-1"

DELIVER EVERYTHING IN A FOLDER STRUCTURE: /barakah-roots-site/ with code, JSON, README, and a dev:run script to start both frontend and server.

FINAL NOTE FOR THE AGENT

    Use content & quotes from the attached Manifesto & Constitution to populate About/Values/Impact sections.

    Keep the site modern, minimal, and trust-building: emphasize transparency (link to constitution & annual reports) and easy calls-to-action for adoption and volunteering.

    Include a small admin endpoint to upload the annual report PDFs and display them on a transparency page.

Now generate:

    A zip-ready project scaffold (file tree + key files) with sample code for the Home page, Header, Footer, Hero, Project card, and API stubs.

    A README with install, dev, build, and deployment instructions.

    A short style guide (colors, fonts, spacing, motion timings).

Do not ask clarifying questions — assume the manifesto and constitution are the source of truth for content and values. Use the cream + light green palette provided unless adjustments are needed for accessibility.
