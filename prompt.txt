You are an AI tasked with fixing and upgrading a STATIC HTML website for “Barakah Roots — Kenya Youth Agricultural Initiative.” The site is built using HTML + CSS + jQuery plugins, based on a customized Namari template. You must correct all broken functionality, link missing buttons, fix non-working redirect flows, and repair any PDF download buttons.

🔧 1. Fix the Homepage Functional Issues
A. Fix dead CTAs

On index.html, the following buttons do not redirect anywhere, but they MUST:

“Adopt a Seedling” (Hero section)
→ Redirect to: adopt.html

“Join a Planting Drive” (Hero section)
→ Redirect to: projects.html#drives or volunteer.html
(Choose whichever is the most logical based on existing structure.)

Get Involved → Buttons

“Adopt a Seedling” → adopt.html

“Volunteer With Us” → volunteer.html

“Support Our Work” → donate.html (or create donate.html if missing)

Ensure all CTA anchor tags receive actual working href links.

B. Fix unrealistic Impact Figures

In the home impact section (“Trees Planted”, “Youth Trained”, “Tons CO₂ Sequestered”), the numbers are placeholders and unrealistic.

Based on the organization being roughly 3 years old, generate realistic startup-friendly impact numbers for a growing youth agricultural initiative in Kenya.

Suggested realistic ranges:

Trees Planted: 3,500 – 6,000

Youth Trained: 150 – 350

Tons of CO₂ Sequestered: 300 – 900

Replace the placeholder values with realistic, credible figures and update the count-up script accordingly.

🔧 2. Fix Broken Functionality Across ALL Pages

Perform the same analysis and fixes across every other HTML page:

A. Fix ALL buttons, CTAs, and internal navigation links

Examples:

Buttons that visually appear clickable but have missing or # href values → assign correct pages.

Navigation inconsistencies on adopt.html (mentioned in GENERALIZED.md) → make nav uniform across all pages.

B. Fix non-functioning PDF buttons

Locate ALL PDF download links across the site (annual reports, constitution, manifesto, transparency documents, forms, etc.) and:

Fix broken links

Ensure they point to real PDF assets inside /pdfs/ or /documents/

If PDFs do not exist, create placeholder filenames such as:

/pdfs/BarakahRoots-Constitution.pdf

/pdfs/BarakahRoots-Manifesto.pdf

/pdfs/BarakahRoots-AnnualReport2024.pdf

Ensure the “Download” buttons actually download.

C. Validate forms (Adopt form, Volunteer form, Contact form)

Currently some forms are placeholders and do not submit anywhere.

Implement consistent behavior:

Add a working action attribute using a stub /api/form endpoint
OR

Use a static JS handler that shows a success message toast

Make sure:

Fields validate correctly

Errors show properly

Submission does NOT reload the page

Console mock submissions are removed unless kept intentionally

D. Fix lightbox, gallery, and modal issues

Some galleries depend on jQuery plugins. Ensure:

Featherlight / gallery plugins load correctly

Lightbox images open as expected

Broken images or missing gallery items are replaced with working assets

E. Fix navigation structure and breadcrumb issues

Ensure:

Nav is identical across ALL pages

Active page highlight works

Mobile hamburger menu opens/closes correctly

All links navigate to real pages

🔧 3. Update redirects, anchors, and deep-links

Some sections (e.g., timelines, “Get Involved”, “Why Barakah Roots”) contain links pointing to nonexistent anchor IDs.

Fix all:

Internal anchors

Scroll-to-section JS

Missing section IDs

Dead “Learn More” links

🔧 4. Improve Accessibility & SEO While Fixing

While repairing the pages, ensure:

All images have meaningful alt attributes

All buttons are actual <a> links or <button> tags

Color contrast meets AA (use #203122 for text on cream background)

Add missing meta descriptions to any page lacking them

Ensure the sitemap reflects the fixed structure

Refer to GENERALIZED.md for consistency with previous audit.
