Brand: Barakah Roots — Kenya Youth Agricultural Initiative
Theme: Cream background (#FFF7EC) with Light Green accents (#9FD6A5) and Deep Olive accents (#3F7D4A). Use a clean, minimal layout with generous spacing and readable type.

Voice & content: Hopeful, youth-empowering, action-oriented, conversational but professional. Use copy inspired by an attached Manifesto & Constitution (focus: youth leadership, tree planting, climate impact, income generation, transparency). Include these short pieces of copy:
- Headline (hero): "Plant a Tree. Grow a Future."
- Subtext: "Barakah Roots empowers Kenyan youth to plant income-generating fruit trees — creating jobs, cooling communities, and feeding families."
- CTAs: "Adopt a Seedling" (primary), "Join a Planting Drive" (secondary).

Pages and priority:
1. Home: full-bleed hero with two CTAs; animated but subtle background (floating leaves) using CSS/JS animation; impact counters (trees planted, youth trained, CO₂ sequestered) with count-up animation; quick links to Adopt, Volunteer, Workshops, Projects.
2. About: short mission and values pulled from Manifesto & Constitution; link to download full Manifesto & Constitution PDFs.
3. Projects: grid of project cards (image, title, location, tree type, planted/goal, Sponsor button); include a simple filter by region or tree type (JS).
4. Adopt a Seedling: product list of seedlings (Avocado, Mango, Macadamia) with price, benefits, and a 2-step checkout stub (sponsor info + payment placeholder).
5. Volunteer & Events: list upcoming events with RSVP form.
6. Stories/Impact: blog-like posts, testimonials, and photo gallery with lightbox.

Accessibility & performance:
- Use semantic HTML (header, nav, main, article, footer).
- All images must have `alt`. Lazy load non-critical images.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Ensure color contrast for text on cream background meets WCAG AA (use #203122 for text).
- Make forms keyboard navigable, with clear labels and error states.

Design system:
- Fonts: load Inter (body) and Merriweather (hero headings) from Google Fonts.
- Provide CSS variables for colors and spacing.
- Provide exact classes or small utility classes to reproduce primary button, card, focus ring:
  - Primary button: rounded-2xl, padding, background #9FD6A5, white text, subtle shadow, hover lift.
  - Card: rounded-xl, light shadow, hover translateY(-6px).
- Motion timings: hover 180–250ms; entry/exit 300–500ms; easing cubic-bezier(.22,.9,.33,1).

Behavior & micro-interactions:
- Sticky header with subtle backdrop blur after scroll; mobile hamburger opens a sheet.
- Lightbox modal trap focus; ESC to close.
- Count-up animation for impact counters.
- Provide a downloadable PDF certificate placeholder after adoption (generate link stub).

Data & content:
- Populate Projects with the following sample items (title, location, tree_type, planted, goal): Nkubu Avocado Drive (Meru), Mwingi Mango Grove (Kitui), Kilifi Coastal Reforestation (Kilifi), Nakuru Macadamia Pilot (Nakuru), Nairobi Urban Greening (Nairobi).
- Seedlings: Hass Avocado ($2), Apple Mango ($1.5), Macadamia ($3). Provide short descriptions and benefits.

Deliverable:
- Modify the template to include the above pages and components.
- Produce static HTML/CSS/JS files ready to deploy (no server required). For payment and form submissions, create stubs that POST to `/api/*` endpoints (these can be `fetch()` stubs returning mock success).
- Ensure all pages include SEO meta (title, description, OG), `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` generation script (simple JS that lists pages).
- Export a small style guide file (style-guide.html) summarizing colors, fonts, buttons, and motion.

Constraints:
- Keep the site static-first (use minimal JS, no heavy frameworks).
- Keep bundle size small (prefer vanilla JS, small polyfills only if needed).
- Respect privacy: forms should not auto-submit to 3rd-party analytics; include a placeholder consent banner (no real analytics enabled).

Priority: make 'Adopt a Seedling' flow frictionless — a 2-step static flow that collects sponsor info and shows a 'payment' placeholder with instructions to contact the org or pay via mobile money.

Use the cream + light green palette exactly, and use copy inspired by the Manifesto & Constitution when adding mission/values text and headings.
